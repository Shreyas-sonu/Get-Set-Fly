Day 1 Creating Nav Bar and Authentication (Register part- for new user creation)

step-1
create a folder structure as follows
src=>index.js , App.jsx ,global.css ,folders{apis,components,pages}

step 2
create components and compose as follows
app{browser router{navbar(rotes(home,login,register))}}
step2 - description 
nav bar is constant
in navbar there are 2 dynamic links available
we have used NavLink instead of Link here which provides the extra feature activeclassname
Register - Link contain register form for new user
Login  - Form Contains Login form for authenticated users
Home- by default the page will be in home page

REGISTER

we have a form which takes the input from the new users and all the information will be stored.
there are 2 events in Register
1 handle change
2 handle submit

1 handle change

when ever there will be a change in any input fields all the values will be set at the name as key in an state

2 handle submit

there is two fields with same input that is password and confirm password
in handle submit it should have try catch
in try there should condition
cond-1 when password and confirm password are same
the object is consoled and and a react-toastify success msg is displayed

cond-2 when they are different toastify error msg should be thrown

after try catch in the end after submitted all the state values are made "" empty to make the field reset to initial state

for cond-1 we require react-toastify 
the ToastifyContainer should be Composed in the App Component before routes in-order to access the react-toastify messages

the following should b imported
import "react-toastify";
import { ToastContainer } from 'react-toastify';
importantly the below styles should be imported
import "react-toastify/dist/ReactToastify.css";
